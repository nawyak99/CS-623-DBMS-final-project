Creating a Geographic Information System (GIS) Analysis: A project that involves 
analyzing geographic data such as maps and spatial data. You will need a 
database that supports spatial data types, like PostgreSQL (PostGIS).

1. Retrieve Locations of specific features 
2. Calculate Distance between points 
3. Calculate Areas of Interest (specific to each group) 
4. Analyze the queries 
5. Sorting and Limit Executions 
6. Optimize the queries to speed up execution time 
7. N-Optimization of queries 
8. Presentation and Posting to Individual GitHub 
9. Code functionality, documentation and proper output provided

This project is done in postgresql.

I'm attching two files. 
one is with full executed codes (Filename:Final Project Code)
second file is with full executed codes aliong with output screen shots and explanation of codes.(Filename:CS 623 Project 2)
third file is the dataset which I used in this project(Filename:worldcities; Link:https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities)

To View the second file (Filename:CS 623 Project 2) which i attached here, to view that file please use the option view raw and download the file to see all the executed codes along with output
